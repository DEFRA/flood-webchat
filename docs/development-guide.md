# Development Guide

1) Clone the repo
2) Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3) Create a `.env` file in the root of the project (variables are with our other secrets under `node/configLocal/flood-webchat.env`)
4) Run `npm run dev` to run a demo server with hot module reloading on http://localhost:9000.
